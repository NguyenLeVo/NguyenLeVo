Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on speech to spectrogram recognition, ethnic groups classifier, and generative adversarial image enhancement.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning deep learning with FastAI (cliche) by making projects as I go. And I love Python.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything. I love tinkering from embedded hardware to using ml for image classification.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about how I applied first principles to pivot from mechanical engineering to computer science.
