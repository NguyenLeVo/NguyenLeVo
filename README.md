### Hi there 👋

<!--
**NguyenLeVo/NguyenLeVo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on speech to spectrogram recognition, ethnic groups classifier, and generative adversarial image enhancement.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning deep learning with FastAI (cliche) by making projects as I go. And I love Python.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I love tinkering from embedded hardware to using ml for image classification.
- 💬 Ask me about how I applied first principles to pivot from mechanical engineering to computer science. 
- 📫 How to reach me: linkedin.com/in/nguyenlevo & nlvo@seas.upenn.edu
